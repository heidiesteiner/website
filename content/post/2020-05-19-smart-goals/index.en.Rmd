## Goals in Grad School 
Probably the hardest part of graduate school (besides imposter syndrome) is keeping track of all the different research projects and other important deadlines. My PI suggests each of the lab members write 4 to 5 goals a month to stay on track. So far, this tip has been monumental in keeping my progress going (and keeping a track record of my work)!

## SMART Goals
We can't write just any goals. Goals have to be SMART - specific, measureable, attainable, realistic and time-based. You learn very quickly how much work you're able to accomplish in a month which helps to set even better goals the next month.
