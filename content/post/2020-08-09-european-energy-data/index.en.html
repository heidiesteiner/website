<p>For this week’s #TidyTuesday data (European Energy) I made a bunch of plots and used <code>cowplot</code> to format them as one figure.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun trying to make the plots look like the data it was plotting. I think, however, the plots are less readable and more cute…which is fine for #TidyCutesday but not for data science. Next week I will work towards a good analysis and plot.</p>
