<h2>Pharmacogenomics Global Research Network</h2>
<p>(Actually this name is brand new, like yesterday. So in October, when this meeting occurred, the PGRN was still the PharmacoGenomics Research Network).</p>
<p>I presented a poster at the PGRN Annual Meeting in October 2020. I submitted an abstract of a side project I was working on at the time associating warfarin dose with ABO blood types.</p>

<p>This is my first embedded video!</p>
<p>Reader: the video did not load when I knitted the document… Will upload to GitHub and get back to you…
Reader: uploading to GitHub didn’t change anything…trying a new bit of code that looks more like HTML than R…</p>
