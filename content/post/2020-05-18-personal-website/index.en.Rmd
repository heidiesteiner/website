Creating a website has absolutely been a wild ride! 

Adding data to a post
```{r iris}
knitr::kable(head(iris))
```

```{r echo = F, warning=F}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species, group = Species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + 
  theme_bw() 
```

I love data visualization! Check out this plot that I made. It self annotatates the top hits in every chromosome (above suggestive significance).
