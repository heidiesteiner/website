<p>I’ve been MIA! Grad school is exhausting! Alas, it’s summer 2021 and I’m back to update my site with some w’s!</p>
<div id="american-society-of-clinical-pharmacology-and-therapeutics-annual-meeting" class="section level2">
<h2>American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics Annual Meeting</h2>
<p>I presented my work on warfarin stable dose prediction in a diverse population featuring a large proportion of Hispanic/Latino reporting warfarin users at the ASCPT 2021 Annual Meeting (,virtually). I was selected as a <strong>Presidential Trainee Award</strong> winner and was given an hour long Q&amp;A session about my work! In addition my poster was selected as a <strong>Top Poster</strong> and featured a blue ribbon icon during poster viewings. Best part? They paid me!</p>

<h3>Machine Learning Poster Walk</h3>
<p>My poster was also featured during the Machine Learning (NOTE: not the official title of this event) Poster Walk during the ASCPT meeting.</p>
<p>The moral of this science story is: <em>self-select for awards</em>.</p>
