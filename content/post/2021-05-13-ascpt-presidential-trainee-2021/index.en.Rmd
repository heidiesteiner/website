I've been MIA! Grad school is exhausting! Alas, it's summer 2021 and I'm back to update my site with some w's! 

## American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics Annual Meeting 

I presented my work on warfarin stable dose prediction in a diverse population featuring a large proportion of Hispanic/Latino reporting warfarin users at the ASCPT 2021 Annual Meeting (,virtually). I was selected as a **Presidential Trainee Award** winner and was given an hour long Q&A session about my work! In addition my poster was selected as a **Top Poster** and featured a blue ribbon icon during poster viewings. Best part? They paid me! 

### Machine Learning Poster Walk

My poster was also featured during the Machine Learning (NOTE: not the official title of this event) Poster Walk during the ASCPT meeting. 

The moral of this science story is: *self-select for awards*.
